# Forgemaster AI Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to the Forgemaster AI Roadmap repository! This repository is dedicated to managing the development roadmap, feature requests, and community interactions for the Forgemaster AI project.

## Overview 📋

This repository contains templates for reporting issues, requesting features, and submitting patches. Our goal is to maintain a transparent and collaborative development process. The Forgemaster AI team values community input, but reserves the right to make the final call on feature development. All feature requests must be accompanied by a detailed Request for Change (RFC).

4. **Submit Detailed RFCs**: All feature requests must include a detailed RFC. The RFC should outline the proposed solution, technical requirements, impact on existing systems, and an implementation plan.
5. **Vote on Issues**: Community members can vote on issues to indicate their importance. This helps the Forgemaster AI team prioritize development efforts.
6. **Respect Final Decisions**: The Forgemaster AI team has the final say on feature development. Decisions will be published in the RFCs.
